# Session Lifecycle

Lakona owns one framework game session per accepted game RPC session. It does
not own account, player, character, room, or device aggregation.

This document defines session identity, callback binding, disconnect,
expiration, termination, resume, and the Gate / Watchdog / Agent composition
pattern.

For hotfix-backed service binding, see
[hotfix/service-binding.md](hotfix/service-binding.md).

## Core Decisions

- A `GameSessionKey` represents exactly one game RPC session.
- One bound RPC connection is associated with at most one active
  `GameSessionKey`.
- Multiple sessions for the same account, player, character, or room are
  user-managed business state.
- `EndpointName` and `GameEndpointName` are not user-facing concepts in
  generated binding, `ILakonaGameServer`, reliable push APIs, hotfix call
  contexts, or session directory storage.
- `Lakona:Endpoints[]` remains transport listener configuration. It does not
  define framework session sub-identities.
- `GameSessionKey` is server/framework identity. Shared RPC DTOs, generated
  client code, and MemoryPack formatters must not expose, serialize, store, or
  echo it.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| RPC connection | One accepted transport connection known to the RPC server. |
| Connection id | Stable framework id for one accepted RPC connection while it exists. |
| Game session | One framework-owned game session identified by `GameSessionKey`. |
| Session callback binding | A callback contract instance bound to a game session and connection id. |
| Business session group | User-owned grouping such as account, player, character, room member, or device. |
| Transport endpoint | Listener configuration from `Lakona:Endpoints[]`; not part of session identity. |
| Business presence | User-owned online/offline policy derived from session lifecycle hooks. |

## Session Semantics

`GameSessionKey` identifies one framework-owned game RPC session. It is not an
account, player, character, room member, device, or transport channel group.

Starting a new session for an owner must not automatically invalidate other
sessions for the same owner. `OwnerKey` is a user-provided ownership label for
diagnostics, authorization, lookup, or user-maintained indexing. It is not a
framework uniqueness constraint.

If a game wants only one active session per account, it implements that policy
explicitly in server-side user code. If a game wants both a WebSocket control
session and a KCP realtime session for one character, user code stores that
grouping:

```txt
CharacterId
  -> ControlSession: GameSessionKey
  -> RealtimeSession: GameSessionKey
```

Terminating one `GameSessionKey` does not implicitly terminate another. User
code applies cross-session policy when that is the desired product behavior.

## Session Directory

The session directory stores sessions by `GameSessionKey`, not by owner or
endpoint.

Each session stores callback bindings by callback contract type:

```txt
GameSessionKey
  -> ILoginCallback: connection id + callback + state
  -> IChatCallback: connection id + callback + state
```

Binding a callback contract for a session replaces only that callback contract.
Binding a different active `GameSessionKey` to a connection id that already has
an active session binding is invalid. User code must explicitly terminate or
expire the old session before reusing that RPC connection for another game
session.

The session directory or a companion tracker must support connection-id lookup
so the RPC lifecycle bridge can mark sessions disconnected when an RPC
connection closes.

Do not keep `SessionEndpointKey` in the target model. A game session no longer
has framework-owned endpoint children.

## Game Server API

User-facing game server APIs must stay session-oriented:

```csharp
public interface ILakonaGameServer
{
    ValueTask<GameSessionKey> StartSessionAsync<TCallback>(
        string ownerKey,
        string connectionId,
        TCallback callback,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
        where TCallback : class;

    ValueTask BindCurrentSessionAsync<TCallback>(
        string connectionId,
        TCallback callback,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
        where TCallback : class;

    ValueTask<TCallback?> GetCallbackAsync<TCallback>(
        GameSessionKey session,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
        where TCallback : class;

    ValueTask TerminateSessionAsync(
        GameSessionKey session,
        SessionTerminationReason reason,
        string? message = null,
        SessionTerminationOptions? options = null,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

Exact method names can evolve, but the public model must not require users or
generated hotfix proxies to pass endpoint names.

## RPC Lifecycle Bridge

`Lakona.Rpc.Server` exposes neutral lifecycle hooks without referencing
`Lakona.Game`. `Lakona.Game.Server` registers an observer that turns RPC
lifetime into game session lifetime:

```txt
RPC session started
  -> game connection opened
  -> optional user lifecycle hooks

RPC session disconnected
  -> mark the game session bound to that connection disconnected
  -> publish one session-disconnected lifecycle hook
  -> cleanup later expires stale disconnected sessions
```

Session disconnection, expiration, and termination are separate events:

- Disconnection means the current RPC connection was lost and the session may
  still resume before retention expires.
- Expiration means disconnected session state was removed by cleanup policy.
- Termination means an explicit framework operation invalidated the session and
  optionally published a terminal notice.

User lifecycle hooks receive game-level context, not `RpcSession` and not
endpoint names. Business presence policy belongs behind these hooks. Stable
framework code owns the lifecycle bridge and required-contract validation.
Generated and sample App code uses strict zero-template hosting; the framework
registers the lifecycle bridge as part of the default game-server graph.

Replaceable presence, cleanup, room leave, and matchmaking decisions belong in
`Server.Hotfix` lifecycle classes such as `ChatSessionLifecycle`, not in App
lifecycle handlers, App runtime contract files, or `*LifecycleService` classes.

## Hotfix Lifecycle Contract

The framework requires the hotfix assembly to implement the framework-owned
`IGameSessionLifecycle` contract when session lifecycle hooks are active:

```csharp
public interface IGameSessionLifecycle
{
    ValueTask SessionDisconnectedAsync(GameSessionDisconnectedRequest request);

    ValueTask SessionExpiredAsync(GameSessionExpiredRequest request);
}
```

`SessionDisconnectedAsync` is published after an RPC connection bound to a game
session is marked disconnected. `SessionExpiredAsync` is published after cleanup
removes a stale disconnected game session. Both methods are invoked through
stable `[RpcMethod]` ids and hotfix lifecycle wrappers; user-authored hotfix
implementations accept `HotfixLifecycleCall<TRequest>`.

Both request types carry framework session state only:

- `OwnerKey`: the game session owner key, such as a player id.
- `SessionId`: the framework session id.
- `Generation`: the owner session generation.
- `ConnectionId`: the last RPC connection associated with the event.
- `CallbackContractTypeNames`: callback contracts bound before disconnect or
  expiration.

Product policy still belongs in hotfix code, where it can map the session event
to presence, room, matchmaking, or other business cleanup.

## Handshake Gate

No business RPC dispatch occurs before `ClientHello` / `ServerHello`
completes. Handshake failure rejects the connection before user hotfix service
code runs. `ServerHello` reports the resolved reliable push mode; disabled
reliable push is reported as immediate delivery with no ack or replay.

Agar uses `UserActor` for business session grouping. The framework session
directory stores framework session and callback binding state.

## Gate / Watchdog / Agent

Gate / Watchdog / Agent is a recommended composition pattern, not a framework
class. It comes from skynet and maps cleanly onto Lakona's session and actor
model.

```txt
Client -> Gate -> Watchdog -> Agent
```

| Role | Responsibility | Has business state | Failure impact |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- |
| Gate | Maintain client connections and forward messages. No business logic. | No | Client reconnects to another Gate; Agent can remain unchanged. |
| Watchdog | Authenticate, create or bind Agent, then exit the call chain. | Transient | Affects only new or resuming connections. |
| Agent | One-to-one player service. Holds session-facing state. | Yes | Affects only that player. |

The key point is that Gate is stateless. Public internet traffic can hit cheap
Gate nodes while player state lives behind Agents or actors.

For low-latency games, add a realtime channel:

```txt
Client -> Gate -> Watchdog -> Agent   control, low-frequency
Client -> KCP direct -> Room          realtime, high-frequency
```

The control and realtime channels are independent RPC sessions. Losing one does
not directly change the other unless user business code links them and applies
that policy.

Lakona mechanisms for the pattern:

| Need | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Gate TCP/WebSocket listener | endpoint configuration and RPC server hosting |
| Gate to Agent routing | cluster routing and route directory |
| Watchdog auth and session bind | user auth plus `ILakonaGameServer.StartSessionAsync` |
| Agent per-player state | actor runtime with per-player `ActorId` |
| Reconnect to another Gate | resume token and session resume service |
| Realtime channel | KCP endpoint plus separate `GameSessionKey` |
| Reliable delivery | reliable push outbox/inbox |
| Server-initiated disconnect | `ILakonaGameServer.TerminateSessionAsync` |

## Server-Initiated Termination

When the server must remove a player from an active session, treat it as a
terminal lifecycle transition, not as a raw transport close.

Recommended flow:

1. The Agent or server policy decides the session must end.
2. Server code calls `ILakonaGameServer.TerminateSessionAsync`.
3. Lakona marks the session terminal before notifying the client, so new
   business work for that session is rejected deterministically.
4. Lakona sends a fixed `SessionTerminationNotice` through the
   `ILakonaGameSessionCallback` bound to that `GameSessionKey`.
5. Lakona waits only up to `SessionTerminationOptions.NotifyTimeout`, then asks
   the configured session closer to close the stored connection id.
6. Later resume attempts return the terminal outcome when
   `KeepTerminalStateForResume` is enabled.

```csharp
await gameServer.TerminateSessionAsync(
    session,
    SessionTerminationReason.ReplacedByNewLogin,
    message: "This account logged in elsewhere.");
```

`SessionTerminationReason` is the only machine-readable reason.
`SessionTerminationNotice.Message` is optional display context and should not
become a second product-specific reason catalog.

The notice is best-effort. Correct clients must still handle the fallback path
where they only observe a disconnect and then receive
`SessionResumeStatus.Terminated` or another terminal outcome during
resume/login.

## Reliable Push And Resume

Reliable push uses the callback binding for a `GameSessionKey`. Resume policy
may rebind a disconnected game session to a new RPC connection when the resume
token and retention policy allow it.

Resume tokens are opaque client-facing credentials. They should not reveal
`GameSessionKey` or become business identity. User code may associate resume
state with account, player, character, room, or device records when it needs
product-specific policy.

## Validation Requirements

Tests and source scans should reject these patterns in generated projects and
framework-facing docs:

```txt
EndpointName
GameEndpointName
SessionEndpointKey
OnEndpointBound
OnEndpointDisconnected
OnEndpointExpired
RpcSession.Disconnected +=
```

Allow those names only in tests that intentionally cover removed API behavior
or in explicitly historical release notes.
