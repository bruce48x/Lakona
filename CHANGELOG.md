# Changelog

This changelog records significant product and architecture milestones. Routine
maintenance and individual patch details are intentionally omitted, while the
date and package versions of important releases are retained.

## 2026-07-13 — Player-focused generated arena

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Tool 0.25.11`.

- Changed generated arena snapshots from client polling to server push resolved
  through each player's current Game Session, without storing callback objects.
- Added direction-aware projectile rendering and player-following cameras for
  generated Unity, Tuanjie, and Godot clients.

## 2026-07-13 — Discovered Hotfix host assembly identity

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Game.Server 0.18.7` and `Lakona.Tool 0.25.10`.

- Replaced hard-coded `Shared`, `Server.App`, and obsolete `State.Contracts`
  Hotfix host assembly names with assembly identities discovered from generated
  required service contract types and the actual entry assembly.

## 2026-07-13 — Connection-owned Game Session callbacks

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Game.Server 0.18.6`,
`Lakona.Game.Server.Hotfix 0.8.1`, and `Lakona.Tool 0.25.9`.

- Changed Game Sessions to retain only their current RPC connection id. Client
  callback proxies are now resolved from that live connection when a notification
  is sent, so one session can use any callback contract exposed by its endpoint
  without registering callback objects on the session.
- Added connection-only session start and bind APIs, migrated generated projects
  and samples, and deprecated the callback-binding compatibility overloads.

## 2026-07-13 — Safe local cluster directory bootstrap

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Game.Server 0.18.5` and `Lakona.Tool 0.25.8`.

- Added opt-in SQL directory schema bootstrap before cluster node registration,
  allowing local Agar deployments to reuse and upgrade existing PostgreSQL
  volumes while production deployments retain controlled schema migration.

## 2026-07-11 — Resilient game runtime and game-first scaffolding

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Game.Abstractions 0.2.7`,
`Lakona.Game.Client 0.3.11`, `Lakona.Game.Server 0.18.2`,
`Lakona.Game.Server.Hotfix 0.8.0`, `Lakona.Rpc.Analyzers 0.3.9`,
`Lakona.Game.Server.Hotfix.Generators 0.5.2`, `Lakona.Tool 0.25.7`,
`Lakona.Cluster 0.5.0`, `Lakona.Cluster.Rpc 0.4.0`,
`Lakona.Cluster.Rpc.MemoryPack 0.3.0`, and `Lakona.Cluster.Sql 0.4.0`.

- Added keyed Startup Actor service groups with application-defined selection,
  replica failover, transactional publication during hotfix reload, and
  compile-time enforcement that non-public actor state remains owned by its
  unique Hotfix behavior.
- Added persistent and remote node and actor directories, unified local health,
  diagnostics, and administration endpoints, and strengthened startup readiness.
- Replaced the default Chat scaffold with a server-authoritative top-down arena
  for Unity, Tuanjie, Godot, and Console, using engine primitives with no art
  assets; added endpoint-scoped reliable push and negotiated 60-second Game
  Session resume for ordered recovery after short network transitions.
- Redesigned the generated arena across Unity, Tuanjie, and Godot with a live
  battlefield login, broadcast-style HUD, segmented health, readable input,
  slower monsters, and stronger projectile and hit feedback.

## 2026-07-10 — Unified cluster actor protocol

- Unified actor wire names and node-directed reply delivery, removing synthetic
  reply routes and tightening cluster ownership validation.
- Moved reliable-push sequencing to the gateway that owns the client session.

## 2026-07-09 — Attribute-driven hotfix actor hosting

- Replaced configuration-duplicated actor startup discovery with generated,
  attribute-driven hotfix registration and lifecycle handling.

## 2026-07-08 — Routed actor call API

- Added explicit cluster actor hosting and generated `Local`, `Route`, and
  completion-aware actor call APIs.
- Migrated the Agar sample to generated routing while preserving five-second
  matchmaking and battle entry behavior.

## 2026-06-27 — Runtime configuration and diagnostics

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Rpc.Server 0.13.2`,
`Lakona.Rpc.Analyzers 0.3.3`, and `Lakona.Game.Server 0.8.14`.

- Added JSON-array environment binding and hotfix service-provider fallback.
- Improved generated binder and method names in runtime diagnostics.

## 2026-06-22 — Serializer-neutral cluster RPC

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Cluster.Rpc 0.2.2`,
`Lakona.Cluster.Rpc.MemoryPack 0.1.0`, `Lakona.Game.Server 0.8.4`,
`Lakona.Rpc.Serializer.MemoryPack 0.11.2`, and `Lakona.Tool 0.12.10`.

- Separated cluster RPC contracts from their MemoryPack adapter and aligned
  generated projects with the new package boundaries.

## 2026-06-17 — Transactional project generation

**Key release:** `Lakona.Tool 0.12.1`.

- Reworked `lakona-tool new` into a transactional full-project generator with
  root documentation, repository metadata, safer ignore rules, and optional Git
  initialization.

## 2026-06-12 — Generated clients and load testing

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Game.LoadTesting 0.1.0`,
`Lakona.Tool 0.10.6`, `Lakona.Game.Server 0.5.2`,
`Lakona.Game.Server.Hotfix 0.2.2`, and
`Lakona.Game.Server.Hotfix.Generators 0.1.3`.

- Added generated console clients and a reusable load-testing package.
- Expanded generated hotfix service discovery and server integration.

## 2026-06-10 — Production network listeners

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Rpc.Transport.Kcp 0.11.15`,
`Lakona.Rpc.Transport.Tcp 0.11.6`, `Lakona.Rpc.Transport.WebSocket 0.11.8`,
and `Lakona.Tool 0.8.21`.

- Added DNS hostname and IPv6 support to TCP, WebSocket, and KCP listeners with
  loopback-safe local defaults.

## 2026-06-07 — Unified Lakona platform

**Key releases:** `Lakona.Tool 0.7.0` and `Lakona.Game.Server 0.4.0`.

- Established the unified project-generation workflow and moved the actor
  mailbox runtime behind the public `Lakona.Game.Server.Actors` boundary.
