# Implement a Lakona Hotfix Component

Keep business logic in Hotfix and stable data/resource handles in App. Reuse DI,
role discovery and generation ownership; do not add an Actor, anonymous State,
background-task framework or extra container.

## Workflow

1. Read project instructions, relevant README sections, and neighboring
   components. Inspect installed framework APIs and project roles (`ServerApp`
   for App, `Hotfix` for Hotfix); do not assume this framework's source checkout
   or contributor docs are present.
2. Identify consumers, resource ownership and node roles. Consumers inject the
   concrete component; State has one owner and must not escape it.
3. Declare a top-level public sealed non-generic component with one public
   constructor. Keep injected fields private and readonly. If needed, add
   ComponentState in App: top-level, public, sealed, non-generic, with a public
   parameterless constructor initializing basic structures only. Do not register
   State manually or add empty State to stateless tools. State is optional, but
   its `[ComponentState]` marker is mandatory when used. Directly writing fields
   or properties through an injected App object requires marked State; manual
   Singleton registration is not a substitute (`LAKONA20062`). Reads, stable
   resource APIs, third-party clients and new DTO initialization remain valid.
   Inject at most one State directly by its concrete type, with a required,
   unkeyed, by-value parameter. Retain it in one private readonly field or private
   get-only auto-property, or use the primary-constructor capture directly;
   do not retain both. Do not erase State to object/interfaces or wrap it in
   arrays, collections, factories or nested generics (`LAKONA20061`). One State
   type has one component owner even when NodeRole differs. This restriction
   concerns marked State; ordinary stable resource interfaces/wrappers remain valid.
4. Read [resource-patterns.md](references/resource-patterns.md) for initialization
   and disposal. Put optional stable resource registration on the HotfixComponent:
   `[ComponentConfigureServices] public static void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection
   services, IConfiguration configuration)`. Framework discovery invokes it before
   root Build. Do not add a State solely for registration. This entry accepts
   unkeyed singletons of closed stable types using types or factories. Root DI
   materializes resources once; the framework then clears the Hotfix factory
   delegates, while resources remain alive until node disposal. No Hotfix
   objects/callbacks may survive in a resource. Constructors and registration do
   no I/O. Keep client-library dependencies in the App deployment closure.
5. Add optional ComponentStart/ComponentStop methods: public instance non-generic
   ValueTask(CancellationToken), with one mandatory by-value token. Each kind
   occurs at most once; the attribute binds the method, not its name.
6. Declare component dependencies with required unkeyed concrete parameters.
   Component interfaces, collections, factories, overrides and service locators
   are unsupported. Stable infrastructure interfaces remain supported.
7. Add NodeRole for a role-specific component; no marker means all nodes. Its
   NodeRole filters registration before requiring data-only configuration.
   Registration has deterministic component-name ordering,
   not constructor dependency ordering. Normal DI and TryAdd semantics apply.
8. Verify changed contracts with focused tests. Resource/readiness changes need
   real dependency startup or the project's integration/E2E check, including
   explicit failures. Reuse existing coverage rather than running every scenario
   below for every edit.

## Lifecycle and reload

Start runs once in dependency order before consumers. Final Stop uses the latest
generation in recorded reverse order. Reload replaces logic with the same State
and runs neither hook. Component full names, effective set and State binding are
fixed until restart; dependency changes must preserve the recorded order. Start
edits do not reinitialize a running node. State layout changes require restart.

Components allow concurrent ordinary calls without a mailbox or automatic call
drain. Use stable synchronization or immutable snapshots. Custom caller owners
stop and await them before shutdown. Managed generation execution and ActorStop
finish before component Stop; provider/root disposal follows. V1 Start and V3
Stop may run on different instances.

No detached tasks, timers, recurring loops or long-lived Hotfix callbacks belong
in components. Use Actor + Behavior and ActorTimer for scheduled work; await
finite component I/O. Never retain Hotfix objects, delegates, tasks, providers or
collectible metadata in State.

## Validation

Cover affected ordering, State identity across real DLL reload, role filtering,
illegal registration, failed-candidate cleanup and final disposal. Validate does
not run Start. Startup failure keeps readiness closed and preserves the original
error. Cleanup failures do not skip other owners; cancellation is not forced
interruption. Stop after relevant checks pass and report unverified outcomes.

For framework lifecycle or hosting changes, select the relevant failure paths:

- Stop failure still permits remaining Stops and disposal; rollback shares one
  deadline rather than resetting a timeout per component.
- A publication/activation failure after successful component Start cleans up
  initial startup; an ordinary failed reload preserves the running generation.
- A root resource factory failure disposes already-created resources; a prepared
  Hotfix assembly unloads even if activation never reached Start.
- Awaited Start gates readiness and awaited Stop gates disposal. Preserve
  ActorStop → ComponentStop → generation cleanup → State disposal, and verify
  frozen component identity/set/State binding during publication.
